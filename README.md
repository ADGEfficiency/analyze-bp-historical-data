# BP Historical Dataset Analysis

Starter project analyzing [historical energy data from BP](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.html).

This project is a good template for those looking to build a data analysis portfolio.

The project follows three steps:

1. download & explore data in [exploration.ipynb],
2. put data into a SQLite database with SQLAlchemy in [dataset.ipynb],
3. a dashboard in Streamlit that displays data from this database in [dashboard.py].

A copy of the raw data for this project is in this repository.  It was accessed in Feburary 2023, and is the 2022 version of the Statistical Review of World Energy BP dataset.
