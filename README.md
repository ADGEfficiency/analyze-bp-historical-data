# BP Historical Dataset Analysis

Starter project analyzing historical energy data from BP.

This project is a good template for those looking to build a data analysis portfolio.

The project follows three steps:

1. download & explore data in [exploration.ipynb],
2. put data into a SQLite database with SQLAlchemy in [dataset.ipynb],
3. a dashboard in Streamlit that displays data from this database in [app.py].

The dashboard uses the SQLite database created in step 2 - you will need to run this notebook to run the dashboard locally.
